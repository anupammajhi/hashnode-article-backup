In Linux, to get help or to read the documentation on a particular command we can use either of the three ways: **man**, **info** or **pinfo** .

The help command **man** is more popular and gives concise documentation of how to use a command, whereas the **info** or **pinfo** is the GNU documentation which is more detailed.

I personally liked **pinfo** the most, maybe because I come from a Windows background, but I guess I will use **man** more ðŸ˜€

To get help with any of these documentation commands, just write the documentation command followed by the command with which you need help. Example:

```bash
man date
```

or

```bash
pinfo date
```

or

```bash
info date
```
